FACE DETECTION USING OPENCV 

This is my first project using OpenCV, where I implemented real-time face detection using a Haar cascade classifier. The program captures video from the webcam, detects faces in real-time, and highlights them with blue rectangles.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
- Highlights detected faces with a rectangular box.
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Haar cascade file (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`)
